**4/10/2016, 4:12:08 PM**: Design for the flow bar:
Start a task by putting a name in and pressing start. When someone interrupts you, you press pause. When they go away, you press resume. Finally when you're done, you press stop.
When you resume, if you dont remember what you were doing, then hit replay. This will undo X steps, wait, and replay them again so you remember what you were doing.

Buttons required, therefore, are: start/pause/resume, rewind, stop.

State machine for states: not started, started, paused, resumed, stopped.
