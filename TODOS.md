[X] Replace text with font-awesome icons
[ ] Integrate with lilbro
[X] Make number of rewind steps configurable
[ ] Make usability better:
  - No need for start/stop button: entering a new task = start of task = stop of prev task
  - Add timer that shows either (a)time worked on task or (b) start time of task
  - Keep the pause button
  - When pause hit, change timer to show time away from task
  - and then have the replay button to its right, which now makes sense to hit - the longer you've been away from the task
